# BenchmarkFunctions
This is a running list of benchmark functions for Single and Multi-Objective Optimization problems. I plan to add around 100 Benchmark functions in Python. At present most of the optimization libraries including benchmark functions are available in Matlab. My mission is to create as much open source stuff as possible in Python and reduce the gap between proprietary Matlab and our lovable opensource Python.
This version contains 36 Benchmark Test Functions. Mathematical definitions (or formulae) for these functions are listed here : http://benchmarkfcns.xyz/fcns
