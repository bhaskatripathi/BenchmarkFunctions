# BenchmarkFunctions
This is a running list of benchmark functions for Single and Multi-Objective Optimization problems. 

I plan to add around 100 Benchmark functions in Python. At present most of the optimization libraries including benchmark functions are available in Matlab. My mission is to create as much open source stuff as possible in Python and reduce the gap between proprietary Matlab and our lovable opensource Python.

This version contains 36 Benchmark Test Functions. Mathematical definitions (or formulae) for these functions are listed here : http://benchmarkfcns.xyz/fcns

EDIT 1: 26-DEC-2024
As I am developing a new Optimization Algorithm, so I have added 84 benchmark functions now to test it. The new benchmarks are located in : single_objective_functions.py.
These benchmarks are derived from Xin-She-Yang's book : Nature Inspired Algorithms and Wikipedia link stated in the python file.
The target to complete 100 benchmarks will happen when I invent a new algorithm during my peaceful time.
